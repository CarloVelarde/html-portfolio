<h1> Carlo's Movie Ranking </h1>
<h2> Top 3 Movie List </h2>
<hr> 
<h3> 1. The Prestige </h3>
    <p> I have never guessed so much and then been so wrong. 
    I was kept guessing until the very end and was always 
    switching my stance. 10/10 </p>
<h3> 2. Inception </h3>
    <p> Inception was also a great movie that kept me guessing.
    It has a good mix of action, drama, and suspense. 10/10 </p>
<h3> 3. The Shawshank Redemption </h3>
    <p> Unlike the other two, this movie was fairly straight forward.
        However, the acting and the story is what makes this movie what it is.
        The lesson learned and reality of the world is shown through
        the memorable acting. 10/10
